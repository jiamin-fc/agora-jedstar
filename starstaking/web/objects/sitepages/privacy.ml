		<p>b) To help us improve the Online Services and fix any problems</p>

		<p>We may process this information to pursue our legitimate interests of acquiring new users for our Games.</p>

		<p>We use various forms of marketing to acquire new users. The information we collect about you may be used to improve the relevancy of our marketing, including the creation of ‘lookalike’ audiences. This allows us to offer more relevant marketing to potential new service users without using information that personally identifies you.</p>

		<p>e) To improve the monetization of the Games via in-app purchases</p>

		<p>We may process information (including Basic Information, User Content, Advertising Data and Analytics) to understand how users use our Games, and to compile statistical reports regarding that activity, as well as understanding how users progress, and their current status within a Game. This processing is necessary for us to pursue our legitimate interests of improving the Games and increasing the amount of revenue generated via in-app purchases. This may include the implementation of dynamic pricing models, so that in-app purchases are priced according to relevant factors, such as geography and gameplay progression so that we can offer temporary promotional discounts.</p>

		<p>We will not pass your information to third parties for the purposes of dynamic pricing unless you give your consent should we ask for it. After you have given your consent, you may withdraw it at any time.</p>

		<p>We may also use this information to reward users with benefits that can be used for further enjoyment of the Games from the viewing of certain advertising placed in our Games.</p>

		<p>We will not pass or process your information for the purposes of marketing in general unless you give your consent should we ask for it. After you have given your consent, you may withdraw it at any time.</p>
